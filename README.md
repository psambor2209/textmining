Application of algorithms and text mining techniques - analysis of recipes for served drinks
Welcome to the Data Mining Project that explores and compares the 20 most popular alcohol drinks using R! This project is designed to provide valuable insights into the world of alcoholic beverages by leveraging data mining techniques and the power of R programming.

**Project Overview**
Objective
The primary goal of this project is to analyze and compare 20 of the most popular alcohol drinks. We will delve into the rich world of alcoholic beverages and extract meaningful information from available data sources. By applying data mining techniques, we aim to uncover patterns, and find similarities by grouping them onto clusters.

**Tools and Technologies**
We will utilize the R programming language and a variety of R packages to perform data mining tasks. R is a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization, making it an ideal choice for this project. Some of the key libraries and packages we will use include:

tidyverse: For data manipulation and visualization.
ggplot2: For creating informative data visualizations.
dplyr: For data preprocessing and transformation.
